Hi,
The integration between Jenkins and GitHub should be with the help of a webhook and use the "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" built trigger
I couldn't overcome the local URL issue, I understand that the communication is not working because the address is not public
I tried using ngrok to make the URL public - but it failed on my windows - as you can see in the screenshot (didn't got the forwarding address)

Docker
I have no experience with containers
And I could not install docker on my computer because it is not possible to install Hyper-V on Windows 10 HOME
I would run the official jenkins docker image to work with that
